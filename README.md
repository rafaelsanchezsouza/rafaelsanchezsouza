### Hello there, my name is Rafael! ðŸ‘‹

MS in Mechatronics working as Full Stack Developer. I love all the parts envolved in the process of building applications: to understand how each technology impacts the final product and to be able to modulate that is drives me to go *full stack*!

Writing code for me is like writting a message, therefore I'm strongly guided by the principles of Clean Coding.

### I'm currently focused on learning
- Xamarin and the .NET framework
- React with Typescript

### I have already worked with
- Angular
- React Native
- Java
- C
- Python
