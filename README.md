### Hello there, my name is Rafael! ðŸ‘‹

I work as Full Stack Developer because I love all the parts envolved in the process of building applications. I like to understand how each technology impacts the final product.

I understand that writing code is like writting a message, therefore I'm strongly guided by the principles of Clean Coding.

### I'm currently focused on learning
- Xamarin and the .NET framework
- React with Typescript

### I have already worked with
- Angular
- React Native
- Java
- C
- Python
